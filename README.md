# Unity project, Data Persistence
Using a Breakout style game.
[Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/submission-data-persistence-in-a-new-repo)


## Features to add into starter project

1. Player name (saving data between scenes)
    - Create a new Start Menu scene for the game with a text entry field prompting the user to enter their name, and a Start button.
    - When the user clicks the Start button, the Main game scene will be loaded and their name will be displayed next to the score.
2. High score (saving data between sessions)
   - As the user plays, the current high score will be displayed on the screen alongside the player name who created the score.
   - If the high score is beaten, the new score and player name will be displayed instead.
   - The highest score will be saved between sessions, so that if the player closes and reopens the application, the high score and player name will be retained.


### Notes

when setting up this project import *all* of the starter files downloaded. Import into Unity, I just copied and pasted them into the main directory.

- **Assets** folder, **Packages** folder, and the **Project Settings** folder.
- I upgraded the project to use **Unity Editor version 2022.3.4f1** which only messed with the rendering some textures are missing colors.
